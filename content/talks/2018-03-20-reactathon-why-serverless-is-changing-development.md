[React world react](https://www.realworldreact.com/talks/2018-03-intro-to-serverless-architecture)

The 'Serverless Architecture' has become massively popular this year, and for the right reasons. Itâ€™s zero-administration nature and pay-per-execution pricing model enable developers to manage less infrastructure and build more than ever. So what are developers actually building with it?
