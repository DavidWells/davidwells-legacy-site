Serverless in the Wild: Real World Use Cases

As serverless technology moves past the emerging technology phase there are more and more great real world examples out there. David Wells, Senior Software Engineer at Serverless Inc., will explore some different use cases for serverless technology with examples from companies and other open source projects. He'll give an overview of the Serverless Framework and also present some of his own open source Serverless projects that were built using the framework.
