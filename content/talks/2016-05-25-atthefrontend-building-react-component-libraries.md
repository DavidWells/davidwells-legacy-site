Over the past 8 months, I have been overhauling the UI at MuleSoft, from angular/bootstrap stack over to React/Redux/ES6/PostCSS.

During this process, I built out a reusable React component library seen here: http://ux.mulesoft.com/ for Mulesoft developers (about 110 devs) to consume.

I'd like to share what I learned from this process of building a scalable component library that needs to be consumed across a wide range of internal developers and some pitfalls to avoid.

I'd also like to elaborate on the internal process of getting people on board and the technology used.
