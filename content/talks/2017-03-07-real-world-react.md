Learn how to build an infinitely scalable, secure, search engine friendly and blazingly fast (dynamically) static site (site/blog) AND application with the same React components.

This talk will walk you through how we rebuilt serverless.com 100% using Phenomic.io and React components and how we leverage the same code base for building products and our public facing marketing site, docs, and blog.
