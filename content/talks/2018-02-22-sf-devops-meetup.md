Despite the hype, "Serverless" is not a magical unicorn that implies then end of ops. Quite the opposite! Devops is still a critical piece of the stack and going serverless only shifts some of the burden onto the provider.

In this talk, David will walk you through how devOps fits into the serverless landscape, what serverless CI + CD flows look like, and how serverless compute layers like lambda can help automate operations.
