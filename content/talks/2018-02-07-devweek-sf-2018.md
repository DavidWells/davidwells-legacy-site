# About the talk:

As serverless technology moves past the emerging technology phase there are more and more great real world examples out there. I'll talk 7 different use cases for serverless technology with examples from companies and other open source projects. This includes everything from GraphQL APIs to chatbots to data processing systems. After this talk, you'll surely have some ideas for getting started with serverless.
