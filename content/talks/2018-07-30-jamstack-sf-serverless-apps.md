In this meetup, we will showcase a non-trivial app built on the JAMstack. We'll tackle some of the hardest challenges of building applications: search, identity, extensibility and deployment -- and we'll do it without a server. We'll build and deploy a fully-functioning application that uses React on the frontend, APIs to manage search and identity, serverless functions to add dynamic functionality, and we'll wrap it all up by showing how to deploy this application securely (without being experts at DevOps).
