## Global Software Architecture Conference

Serverless Track: Building Event Driven Serverless Microservices

The "Serverless Architecture" has become massively popular this year, and for the right reasons. It’s zero-administration nature and pay-per-execution pricing model enable developers to manage less infrastructure and build more than ever. So what are developers actually building with it?

What are the obvious use-cases and what use-cases aren't so obvious?

Here, we'll chat about the benefits of the Serverless Architecture and take a tour of the expected and unexpected use-cases these benefits are inspiring. From bitcoin trading platforms to garden monitoring tools to the automation of everything, we’ll explore the potential of serverless, and how empowering it can be for companies and individual developers alike.
