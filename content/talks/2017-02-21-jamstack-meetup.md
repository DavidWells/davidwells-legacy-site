Markdown is the language of choice for most static site generators and for documentation. Did you know Markdown can be even more powerful than you realize? In this talk, David will cover some advanced markdown tips and tricks serverless uses to enhance their documentation and site content.

- Advanced GitHub markdown techniques for better formatting
- How to extend and enhance markdown files from external sources (including JSON files/databases)
- How to pull in external content into markdown via [markdown magic](https://github.com/DavidWells/markdown-magic)

David will walk through how their site build process pulls in a number of repositories, processes them, and how they come together to form Serverless.com
