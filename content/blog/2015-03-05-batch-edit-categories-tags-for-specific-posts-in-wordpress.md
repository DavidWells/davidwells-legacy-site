I just imported a blog with 400+ posts from Tumblr to WordPress and needed a way to bulk tag and bulk manage the categories of the imported posts. Everything is lumped into ‘uncategorized’ so I needed a way to select specific posts at the same time and bulk categorize them All plugins publicly avialable on the WordPress repo don’t let you select specific posts to bulk manage. I found a plugin a while back that was great for this, unfortunately, its gone. This plugin: [Batch Categories](https://web.archive.org/web/20130730063036/http://robm.me.uk/2006/12/13/batch-categories) no longer exists from the original author or in the WordPress Repo. But today is your lucky day! I found it in an old folder. [Download it here](http://davidwells.tv/wp-content/uploads/dl/batch-categories.zip).

## Heres how it works:

### Go to bulk edit screen

### All Done. Easy as that!
