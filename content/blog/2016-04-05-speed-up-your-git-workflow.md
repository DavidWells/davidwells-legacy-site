Repetitive tasks suck.

How many times do you open your browser start typing `github.com/projectXYZ/blahblahyabadabadoo`?

Navigating to a github repository to submit a pull request or check on a project's status/issues doesn't need to be suck!

With [git open](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open) you can jump directly to the repo you are working on in your browser.

Millions of hours saved!

Props to [Paul Irish](https://twitter.com/paul_irish) for this gem

```bash
npm install git-open -g

Now you have more time for all the things!
