It would seem that a mountain of opportunity exists in industries and situations where creativity seems vacant.

Banksy created art out of normal everyday street objects.

Walt Disney created a magical wonderland out of a swamp.

Steve jobs created a user friendly music player in a world where the more buttons/features used to win.

Everyday people are finding stagnant situations and rewriting the rules.

The next "problem" you encounter ask yourself, if I had the power to change this, what would I do differently to improve the experience?

Now remove <strong>if</strong> from that statement and <strong>do it.</strong>
