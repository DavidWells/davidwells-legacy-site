Sometimes I'm not sure where I'm going.

I know I'm moving and there are tracks behind me. Perhaps this is what is important.

The hardest part of doing something is starting.

Once in motion, you start working towards a flow. Once you are in flow (aka in the zone) it's easy to make progress.

Keeping that lucid state on track towards an ambiguous destination, now that's a challenge.

As long as I'm moving, there is a sense of purpose. Perhaps that <strong>is</strong> the destination?

Eventually you will reach your destination or realize there isn't one to begin with and the journey was the destination all along.

One thing is for sure though: I'm not sure <strong>where</strong> I'm going but <strong>I'm going</strong>.
