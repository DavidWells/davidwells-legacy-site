Success. It comes in a variety of flavors, shapes, and sizes.

How do you get there? Once you have arrived, how are you sure? How fleeting is the moment?

> The road to success is always under construction. -Jim Miller

The road to success seems to be like a mirage off into the distance. Upon arrival, the feeling of elation rushes through you as you raise your fists to the heavens "I've done it", you proclaim, "I've made it".

"Made what?", you wonder, as the moment has passes.

Off in the distance you notice something new. You want to go there, you want that to be you.

It's a vicious cycle.

When is enough enough? Or is there such a limit?

The age old question is for you to decide, after all you are the one building your road.
