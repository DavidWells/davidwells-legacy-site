Here at Socialize Your Cause, we are trying to ramp up our online video game. In doing so, we are proud to announce our first installment of our <strong>"Expert Interview Series,"</strong> where we will be interviewing the brightest minds within the Social Media and NPO marketing world and sharing their insights and knowledge with our readers.

We were fortunate enough to grab an interview with Shama Kabani Author of the <a href="http://zenofsocialmedia.com/">Zen of Social Media Marketing</a> before she took off for a conference in Europe!

We talk about different ways for NPOs to break into social media who are just starting out, how social media isn't a cure all for all of your marketing needs but a piece of the overall puzzle, the importance of having a decent looking website for building trust with donors, using social media to really tell your organization's story, her take on the facebook open graph announcement and much, much more!
