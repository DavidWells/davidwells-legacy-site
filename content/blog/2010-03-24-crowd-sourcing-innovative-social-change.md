SXSW is an amazing conference populated by the smartest minds in the social media industry. We highly recommend that someone in your organization go to SXSW. The new and interesting techniques on how to utilize new technologies for your non-profit are plentiful and the networking at SXSW is priceless! This is a panel on "crowdsourcing innovative social change".  In this video you will see a room full of people, like you and I, who are leveraging social media to further and spread their causes to audiences they never thought possible to reach just a few years back.  I met some truly amazing people in this room (not to mention the other four days of the conference!) This panel is all about how to crowdsource ideas and actions from your supporters! Crowdsourcing is defined as getting ideas, content or other things from a wide swath of people. It can be extremely powerful for NPOs, especially those who are strapped for cash and/or man power. Asking your community for their feedback and ideas can go a long way. P.S.  The presentation itself was crowdsourced! Panelists are:
