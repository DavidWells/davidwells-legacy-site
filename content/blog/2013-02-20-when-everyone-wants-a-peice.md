Sometimes it seems that everyone reaching out to you wants  something.

A favor, a referral, a sale, <strong>something to take.</strong>

The subtle intricacies of a give first and ask later relationship seems like a foreign concept.

There is no patience, and I have no patience for it.

People who succeed in life, and I mean really succeed, are masterful at crafting relationships by giving first and cashing in goodwill second.

So the next time you ask for something, (be it someone's time, money or attention) first ask yourself:

"What can I give them? What have I given to them? How can I help this person in their life?"

If the answer is nothing. Fix that.
