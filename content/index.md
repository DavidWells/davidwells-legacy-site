> **TL;DR** – Marketing nerd turned full stack developer & entrepreneur.

I’m a Developer Experience Engineer at [Netlify](http://netlify.com) in San Francisco.

Previously, I was working as a full stack developer + dev advocate at [Serverless](http://serverless.com). Before that, I was lead developer on UI/UX team building design systems at [Mulesoft](http://www.mulesoft.com).

Way back when, I founded [Inbound Now](http://www.inboundnow.com), where we made open source inbound marketing software.

Before learning to code, I was a marketing consultant working at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com). I've helped hundreds of companies with their content strategy, conversion rate optimization and inbound lead generation.

Today, I focus on **serverless cloud architecture**, **user experience**, and **product development**
