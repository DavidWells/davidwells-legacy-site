> **TL;DR** – Marketing nerd turned full stack developer & entrepreneur.

I’m a full stack developer at [Serverless Inc](http://serverless.com) in San Francisco.

Previously, I was working at [Mulesoft](http://www.mulesoft.com) as the lead developer on UI/UX team. Before that, I founded [Inbound Now](http://www.inboundnow.com), where we made open source inbound marketing software.

Before slinging code, I was a marketing consultant working at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com). I've helped hundreds of companies with conversion rate optimization and inbound lead generation.

Today, I focus on **serverless cloud architecture**, **user experience**, and **product development**
