# About David Wells

> **TL;DR** – Marketing nerd turned full stack developer & entrepreneur.

I’m a full stack javascript developer in San Francisco currently working at [Serverless](http://serverless.com).

Previously, I was working at [Mulesoft](http://www.mulesoft.com) as the lead developer on UI/UX team. Before that, I founded [Inbound Now](http://www.inboundnow.com), where we made open source inbound marketing software.

Before becoming a developer, I was a marketing consultant working at [HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com). I've helped hundreds of companies optimize site conversions and inbound lead generation.

Today, I focus on **user experience**, **UI** and **product development**
