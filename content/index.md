# About David Wells

> **TL;DR** – Marketer turned developer & entrepreneur.

I’m a full stack javascript developer in San Francisco currently working at [Serverless](http://serverless.com).

Previously I was working at Mulesoft as the lead developer on UI/UX team. I founded [Inbound Now](http://www.inboundnow.com) (now advisor), where we make open source marketing software.

Before that, I consulted with hundreds of companies helping them implement conversion optimization strategies to increase inbound web leads.

You could call me a jack of all trades and a master of some.

**JavaScript, Node, HTML, CSS, Marketing, UI and UX.** Are my passions
