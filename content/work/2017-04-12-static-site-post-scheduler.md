# Static Site Post Scheduler

[Repo](https://github.com/serverless/post-scheduler)

The post scheduler is a [serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) project that gives static site owners the ability to schedule posts (or other site content).

It works with any static site setup (Jekyll, Hugo, Phenomic, Gatsby etc.)

## How does it work?

1. A github webhook fires when pull requests (aka new posts) are updated.

2. If the pull request comment has a comment matching `schedule(MM/DD/YYYY H:MM pm)` and the person is a collaborator on the project, the post gets scheduled for you.

3. A serverless cron job runs every hour to check if a post is ready to be published

4. When the post is ready to be published, the cron function automatically merges the branch into `master` and your site, if you have CI/CD built in, will redeploy itself.

To cancel scheduled posts, delete the scheduled comment and it will unschedule the branch.
