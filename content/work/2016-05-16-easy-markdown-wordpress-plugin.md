> Write github flavored markdown in WordPress without the hassle

Blogging about code in WordPress has historically been a **HUGE** pain in the ass.

TinyMCE and the WordPress visual editor garble your code like it's their job.

I've tried every single syntax highlighter plugin in existence.

They all fell short in one way or another.

So like any good developer. I rolled my own.
