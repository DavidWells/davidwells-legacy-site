# Scope

Scope is a customizable bird's eye view of your Github project.

[Repo](http://github.com/serverless/scope)

It automatically pulls in issues & Pull requests and sorts them into columns you define. Think github projects on steroids.

Built using event driven serverless tech, the application can be cloned down, configured, & deployed for your project in minutes.

Deploy it as a stand-alone application or embed it directly into your project's site.
