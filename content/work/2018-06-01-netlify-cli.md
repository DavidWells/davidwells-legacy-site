# Netlify CLI

Rebuilt the netlify command line interface.

[Docs](https://cli.netlify.com/) | [Repo](https://github.com/netlify/cli/)

This was a fun project and a revamp of the older Go based netlify CLI.

I worked on:

- Designing the CLI API
- Managing the project
- IC on project
- Built [docs site](https://cli.netlify.com/)
