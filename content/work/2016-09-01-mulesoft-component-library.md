# Mulesoft Component Library

Mulesoft needed to port over some legacy angular one applications into a more modern centralized stack.

I worked with the UX team to create a scalable component library for all internal product teams to use.

This was an interesting project because the components we built need to work in new greenfield projects as well as inside legacy angular one applications.
