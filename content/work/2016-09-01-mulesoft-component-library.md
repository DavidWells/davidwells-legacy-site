# Mulesoft Component Library

**Demo Link:** <a href="http://ux.mulesoft/">http://ux.mulesoft.com/</a>

Mulesoft needed to port over some legacy angular one applications into a more modern centralized stack.

I came in and worked with the UX team to create a scalable component library for product teams to implement.

This was an interesting project because the components we built need to work in new greenfield projects as well as inside legacy angular one applications.
