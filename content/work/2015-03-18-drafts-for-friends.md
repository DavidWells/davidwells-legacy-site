# Drafts for Friends

**Contributors:** David Wells

**Client:** The internet

**Date:** 2015

**Code: **[Download from Github](https://github.com/DavidWells/share-wordpress-drafts-with-non-users)

**Tags:** React, JavaScript, PHP, WordPress, Plugin

This WordPress plugin gives you the ability to share drafted content with your friends without them logging into WordPress.

The drafts are visible for a transient amount of time, then they revert to private drafts that require a login to view.

This was a WordPress plugin built with React. The entire user interface is JavaScript driven.

PHP runs in the background to fetch the required data from WordPress.
