# WordPress Leads

**Contributors:** David Wells, Hudson Atwell

**Client:** Inbound Now

**Date:** 2012

**Demo Link:** [http://www.inboundnow.com/collecting-advanced-lead-intelligence-wordpress-free/](http://www.inboundnow.com/collecting-advanced-lead-intelligence-wordpress-free/)

**Tags:** WordPress, Plugin, PHP, JavaScript

Track visitor activity, capture and manage incoming leads, and send collected emails to your email service provider.

Gives people free access to powerful marketing data that would otherwise cost hundreds (or thousands) of dollars a month with other solutions.

This was fun to build.
