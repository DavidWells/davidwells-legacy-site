The goal of the project was to help small businesses grow their inbound lead flow. Along the way, We built:

- a complete A/B testing suite for [landing pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/) and [calls to action](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cta/)
- a [lead tracking framework](http://davidwells.io/portfolio/inbound-analytics/) - a [lead management system](https://wordpress.org/plugins/leads/)
- and integrated a huge amount of [third party tools and APIs](https://www.inboundnow.com/marketplace/)

We surpassed 1 million downloads and there are currently 40,000 active sites using Inbound Now tools. (as of march 2016)
