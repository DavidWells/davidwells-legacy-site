Anyone can learn how to code.

It's not rocket science. Watch this:

Convinced yet?

I had no background in any computer science before I started my business, I majored in Marketing andÂ Entrepreneurship.

I never took a single programming class in my entire life.

How did I do it then?

**Google, a whole lot of Google**.

Everything that you need is freely available online.

It also helps to meet someone who is a master. Having some hands on help when you hit the wall, is key.

Now, go forth and <strong>future proof your skill set</strong>.
