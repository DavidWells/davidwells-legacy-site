[Surge.sh](http://surge.sh) is one of my favorite developer tools.

It will allow you to launch static sites & demos to a live web URL in literally seconds from your terminal.

# Step 1: Install it

```bash
# Install surge.sh on your machine
 npm install --global surge
# In your project directory, just runâ€¦
$ surge
```

# Step 2: deploy

`cd` into your projects directory and then run `surge`.

Point it to the correct file paths and boom. Done.

Your site will be live.

# Pro Tips

Avoid retyping your custom domain everything with an npm script with `surge --domain your-surge-subdomain-you-chose.surge.sh`

Example `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "your-project-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "deploy": "surge --domain apple-login.surge.sh",
  },
}
```

They also allow for mapping custom domains for... FREE!

[Instructions on how to setup your custom domain](http://surge.sh/help/adding-a-custom-domain)

After setting up your CNAME or A Record for your custom domain, run `echo your-own-domain.com > CNAME` in your project's root directory to avoid retyping it. After doing so, you can simply deploy to your custom domain using the `surge` command.

Great service. Amazingly easy and simple.

This is a must use for any developer trying to share a demo or stand up a static site without dealing with setting up your own server.

## Serverless for the win!
