As a UX rule of thumb, always assume your user will need special help to achieve even the simplest of tasks.

Much like helping a drunk friend brush their teeth, assume that your user is non-technical.

Guide them through tasks making it (next to) impossible for them to get tripped up.

# You are clear and sober

You've probably spent hours and hours honing your design and flow to be perfect.

Kudos! **You should be doing this.**

This, however, comes with a cost:

**You become too familiar with your interface.**  

What might be obvious to you might escape the drunk user.

# How to fix?

- Back away. Take a breath
- Get a brand spankin' new person to drive through your product
- Watch silently as they fail and encounter fiction
- Take notes about these points of friction
- Fix them
- Rinse then Repeat

Get into the mindset of the 'drunk' user.

Start to imagine where things could go wrong and fix those sharp edges.
