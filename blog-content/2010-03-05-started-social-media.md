[Chris](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/) points out social media is free and inexpensive, moves fast, presents an opportunity to humanize/ show passion, and many times can have a larger impact than most traditional marketing channels.

##### Notables:

**1.** Most tools are free and/or inexpensive (i.e. blogging, podcasts, and videos – specifically sites like Facebook, Twitter, & Wordpress).

**2.** These tools give opportunity to _humanize_; a video gives viewers the opportunity to see a face (face>text) and **passion** is visualized.  If you are trying to raise awareness for a cause try uploading a video on your website/blog of you explaining it or (if possible) actually doing it.

**3.** A message moves QUICKLY through social media without taking much of your time or money.

**4.** Larger impacts can be made using social media over traditional marketing channels.

### Chris’  Tips for Easily Getting Started in Social Media:

*   **Find** </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">where your target  market is interacting and build an account (Twitter, Facebook, Wordpress = free)</span>
*   **Build** out profile – decide what you are/are not interested in sharing
*   Upload a picture/video = **humanize** your profile
*   LISTEN/OBSERVE:  for example, go to “[search.twitter.com](http://search.twitter.com/)” and see what people are talking about & are interested in.  This also gives you the opportunity to see how others who are interested in the same things utilize a particular social media/networking tool.  You can start out by modeling their behavior until you get the hang of it.
*   **Follow** them & build your social network—it becomes organic
*   Don’t be afraid to **experiment**
