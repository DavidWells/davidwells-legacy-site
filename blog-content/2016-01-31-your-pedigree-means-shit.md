An interesting thought to ponder:

Does your educational pedigree matter for building software?

I'd say no. A formal CS degree helps but it's not completely necessary.

What matters to me, is what the person is **capable of, right now,** and what got them here (a.k.a their body of work)

Some of the brightest bulbs I've ever met never had a lick of formal CS training. They are "self" taught rock stars, who learned from google searches, videos, books, and generous mentors.

**Side note:** Not knocking CS Degrees. If you have one, kudos to you! I often wish I was able to take some CS courses during my college career. =)

# The problem with pedigrees

Pedigrees serve stereotypes.

Stereotypes help people make faster decisions but, alas, not always the correct one.

**Lets try to evaluate folks based on merits** rather than `where they went to school` or what they are `formally trained in`

Also, when interviewing potential candidates try to avoid these [dev interviews pitfalls](http://zachholman.com/posts/startup-interviewing-is-fucked/)

# Your pedigree means shit.

# The only thing that matters is what you deliver

Are you shipping quality? Keep on keeping on
