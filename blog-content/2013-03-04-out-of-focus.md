Recently I've been feeling more and more out of focus.

I am in the middle of 6 concurrent projects and I'm solving too many problems at once.

Focus is spread between too many things and its hard to keep sight on a single direction.

Luckily, the end is in sight. Things are finally winding down.

I certainly have learned a valuable lesson in all the chaos. It's vividly clear to me what my core skills are and where my weaknesses lie.

Perhaps one needs to reach the brink of insanity to find out what is truly important.

What do you do to ensure you are focusing on the <strong>right</strong> things?

If the answer alludes you, Fix it.
