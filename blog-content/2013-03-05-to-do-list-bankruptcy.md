What does your to-do list look like?

Mine typically grows and grows over time until the list is a mile long and the bane of my existence.

The growing number of action items become unmanageable and a hazard to my sanity.

At this point, I declare to-do list bankruptcy.

It's time to clear your cache, reboot, and start over.

The list is combed through for things that actually matter, everything is deleted, and I get a fresh start.

So the next time you run up an impossible list, it's okay to take a machete to it.

Just tell them I gave you permission.
